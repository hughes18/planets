Titan is my favorite solar system body, not counting the one we live on.
It's like bizarro-Earth - water is the main rock, methane and ethane rain from the sky and form lakes and rivers. 
Organics everywhere. Titanians might use oxygen as a chemical weapon like chlorine.
Not totally impossible that there could be life where all the polarities are flipped and methane takes the place fo water.
In a reducing environment like Titan, the chemistry seems upside-down compared to the oxidizing environments seen on Earth and Mars.
